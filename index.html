Print Media VS New Media<br>
If Modern New Media is Causing the Demise of Traditional Print Media?
<br><br>The emergence of new media poses a serious threat to the sustainable development and operation of traditional media, especially in print media. Smartphones and tablets have become a large part of young people’s lives. They can easily navigate the news when connected. Traditional media are forced to innovate in the hope so that they will be more competitive in the market. Although new media and print media have the same word of "media," but the meaning of the media is greatly different.

1. What is Print Media? 
Print Media, or as some refer to as traditional media, has been used in the marketing / advertising world for years. These include newspapers, magazines, flyers and other printed matters.

2. What is New Media?
New media is considered as streaming media— a collection of static photos, dynamic images (including video), sound (on-site sound, post-editing and other sound elements), three-dimensional graphics, Flash and other integrated multi-media collections, is based on the multi-platform release of stereoscopic visual communication system.



3. The biggest issues and challenges facing print media today:
The first generation after 80’s has got used to reading news through the internet. At present, the market for print media is mostly the parents. If the times continue to follow up, the reading population of print media will be greatly reduced, or even disappear. Newspapers and magazines will not disappear in this way, but they are likely to become vinyl records, and definitely not a popular medium. Press releases for traditional media take time, while new media greatly shortens the time consumed for printing distribution. New media does not have lead time. The pity is print media is also to be considered as waste of resources. With print media, there is very little flexibility for change. When a company have a different ad they'd like to run or if they had an error on their offer that’s too bad because it has already gone to print. With new media changes can be made almost instantly, offer, text, image, mostly anything can be re-edited right away. Nowadays, who wants to search through a huge paper directory to find a phone number or address? Young users tend to enjoy searching through many different digital channels from computers, laptops, smartphones and more. In the future, paper-based bigwigs may no longer to print just a printed version, but instead borrow the internet’s power to become a niche media to serve its wider audiences.

4. What are the main factors that led to the rise of new media?
As a result of the evolution of new media technologies, It is introduced to everyone’s life almost everyday and it becomes impossible to keep up with. There are five main advantages about new media. The first one being interaction. Users can easily express their own opinions for others to see right away, which is impossible to do in the print media. It only carries one-to-many, and new media is about many-to-many. Second of all, are the sounds, images, videos, etc, they can exist in the same medium at the same time, without being separated by different medias. Third, New media allows everyone's information to be linked, creating a sense of connection and unity. The fourth advantage comes from equality, the basic idea of the Internet is equality. When the Internet initially allocates resources, the resources allocated to each computer are the same. It is no exaggeration to say that new media represents the civilian culture as soon as it is born, because of the limitation of traditional print media layout and space. Who controls the page will control the right of speech; therefore, only the elite can have the right to speak, resulting in the traditional media to reflect the concept of hierarchy, representing the elite’s culture and elite’s awareness. Finally, the last main advantage about new media is "Free + Charge": taking advantage of the freedom to attract a huge number of users, and building a large platform for resource coordination and sharing, and on this basis, carry out value-added services. For instance, Google is free for users who use their general search engine, subsidized by third-party fees, such as advertisers. Or they transferred their general users to a third-party website so that the third-party website would be charged by google as well. The new media profit model mainly in the following categories: First, advertising revenue. Second, Internet value-added business income, such as the sale of props, game currency and so on. Third, mobile value-added services, such as mobile music downloads. Fourth, hierarchical information service revenue, that is, for business users with high commercial value or have specific needs can have some personalized, customized information services. So these are the factors led to the rise of new media today.

5. Is one gonna live and one gonna die?
They both play important roles. Print used to be the dominant way of delivering content. Now, the market have online media as a very viable competitor to that. It is an environment of a changing society. For certainty, digital will continue to become more prevalent as technology moving forward, but it does not mean the death of print media. Print media and new media can be merged in some ways. For instance, buying books online from a foreign website is good use of both print and new media. User have both experiences on these two medias at the same time. In this case, new media functions as a virtual shopping platform; print media functions as the products of new media. It is the parent-child situation. At this stage, there should be complementary roles for each other to make human life meaningful and efficiency. The fusion essentially revolves around users needs for reengineering of media production processes; the precise positioning of user groups, deep service and product operation is the core of media integration. Some people still live in the user groups of reading printed newspaper and books. Although print media does not have a fast spreading network, some groups of users are accustomed to getting information through newspapers and books. In conclusion, new media will become the mainstream, print media will still have its own market share. Only the proportion is getting lower and lower. Print media will still exist and will not die out.
